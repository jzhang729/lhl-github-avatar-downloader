# GitHub Avatar Downloader

This project is from the new Lighthouse Labs curriculum launched in 2015 to focus more on JavaScript.

## Problem Statement

Given a GitHub repository name and owner, download all the contributors' profile images and save them to a subdirectory, `avatars/`.

## Expected Usage

Two versions of the program exist. The first does not use the [async library](https://caolan.github.io/async) and the second one does.

This program should be executed from the command line, in the following manner:

`node download_avatars_1.js jquery jquery` (no async library)

or

`node download_avatars_2.js jquery jquery` (with async library)
